    <p>Learn how to create authoritative topic clusters and better content with this step-by-step guide to topic modeling.</p>
    <h2>Use Topic Modeling & Topic Clusters, Not Just Keyword Research</h2>
    <p><a href="https://blog.marketmuse.com/topic-modeling-for-seo-explained/">Topic modeling</a> is how machine learning detects and understands related topics and</p>
    <p>themes across multiple pieces of information. This can help you understand what</p>
    <p>pieces to create as part of a topic cluster.</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.marketmuse.com/creating-content-clusters-with-topic-modeling/">Topic clusters</a> are the actual groups of linked related content pieces that have a similar theme.</p>
    <p>As Google’s algorithm continues to evolve, it’s becoming clear that it favors topic</p>
    <p>clusters because they better match the user’s full search journey and user intent.</p>

    <h2>The Difference Between Keyword Lists & Topic Models</h2>
    <p>When conducting <a href="https://blog.marketmuse.com/the-difference-between-keywords-and-topics/">keyword research</a> you’ll typically end up with hundreds of</p>
    <p>different terms and still not have a clear understanding of what’s required to</p>
    <p>adequately cover a subject. It’s a case where more isn’t always better.</p>
    <h3>Topic modeling</h3>
    <p>Topic modeling reveals how experts write about that subject, which directly reflects</p>
    <p>how readers typically journey through a subject.</p>
    <h3>Here’s a short example using the keyword phrase and topic “how to grow tomatoes.”</h3>
    <p>As you can see, comparing keyword research to topic research is like comparing</p>
    <p>apples and oranges. They’re fundamentally different approaches.</p>

<h3>Topic Model</h3>
<p>In SEO, a topic model serves dual roles – prescriptive and descriptive.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prescriptive</strong> means that it indicates what topics need to be covered.</li>
    <li><strong>Descriptive</strong> means that you can verify whether an article covers those required topics.</li>
</ul>
